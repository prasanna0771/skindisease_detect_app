Skin Disease Detection
----------------------

A Deep Learning-powered web application to detect skin diseases from images.

Overview
--------

This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify skin diseases from images.
The model is trained on a dataset of images of various skin diseases and can predict the disease with a high degree of accuracy.

Features
--------

Detects 9 different skin diseases:
Actinic Keratosis
Atopic Dermatitis
Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Benign Keratosis
Dermatofibroma
Melanoma
Melanocytic Nevus
Vascular Lesion
Tinea Ringworm Candidiasis
Provides a list of required medicines for each disease

Requirements
------------

Python
TensorFlow
scikit-learn
Streamlit
pandas
NumPy

Installation
------------

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/skin-disease-detection.git
Install the requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application: streamlit run app.py

Usage
-----

Upload an image of the skin disease
Click the "Detect" button to predict the disease
View the predicted disease and required medicines also.
